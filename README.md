### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Kiprono. I am a Computer Science student and a developer trying to create solutions using code. I would ideally like to combine software development with data science to build data driven and products that can solve problems and derive insights from customers and developers. Outside coding, I spend a considerable amount of time volunteering and mentoring other students.
